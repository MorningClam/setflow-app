      <div class="space-y-4 text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-300">
        <p><strong>Last Updated: October 25, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>By confirming a booking on the Setflow platform, you (the "Booker", typically a Venue or Promoter) and the selected musician or band (the "Artist") agree to be bound by these Standard Booking Agreement terms.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-white">1. Performance Details</h3>
        <p>The Artist agrees to perform at the date, time, and location specified in the electronic "Show Sheet" provided by Setflow upon booking confirmation. The Booker agrees to provide a safe and suitable performance space, including necessary power and agreed-upon technical requirements (e.g., PA system, sound engineer) as detailed in the Gig post or subsequent communication via Setflow messaging.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-white">2. Payment</h3>
        <p>The Booker agrees to pay the Artist the full agreed-upon payout amount ("Payout") as listed on the Booking Confirmation page and Show Sheet. Payment shall be made directly between the Booker and Artist via mutually agreed methods (e.g., cash, check, electronic transfer) within 24 hours following the successful completion of the performance, unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon in writing via Setflow messaging.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-white">3. Cancellation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>By Booker:</strong> Cancellations made by the Booker more than 7 days prior to the performance date incur no penalty. Cancellations made within 7 days but more than 48 hours prior may be subject to a cancellation fee of 25% of the Payout, payable to the Artist. Cancellations made within 48 hours of the performance time may be subject to a cancellation fee of 50% of the Payout. Exceptions may apply for force majeure events.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>By Artist:</strong> Cancellations made by the Artist should be communicated as early as possible. Repeated cancellations may affect the Artist's rating and visibility on the Setflow platform. The Booker is not obligated to pay any Payout if the Artist cancels. Setflow encourages finding a suitable replacement if possible.
        </p>

        <h3 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-white">4. Communication</h3>
        <p>All official communication regarding the booking details, changes, or issues should ideally occur through the Setflow messaging system to maintain a record.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-white">5. Setflow's Role</h3>
        <p>Setflow acts as a platform to facilitate connections and bookings between Bookers and Artists. Setflow is not a party to this direct agreement between the Booker and Artist and is not responsible for payment processing, performance quality, or dispute resolution beyond platform-level moderation (e.g., reviews, reporting). Users agree to Setflow's general Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3 class="pt-2 text-base font-semibold text-white">6. Conduct</h3>
        <p>Both parties agree to act professionally and respectfully towards each other, venue staff, and patrons. Any breach of conduct may be reported to Setflow.</p>

        <p class="pt-4 text-xs text-neutral-400">This is a simplified placeholder agreement. Real-world terms would require more detail regarding technical riders, insurance, liability, dispute resolution, etc.</p>
